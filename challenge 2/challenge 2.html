        <h1>All About <span>Cats</span></h1>
        <p>The <span>Cats</span> is similar in anatomy to the other
             felid species: it has a strong flexible body,
              quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws
               adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and
                sense of smell are well developed. 
                <span>Cats</span> communication includes vocalizations like meowing
                , purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as
                 well as <span>Cats</span>-specific body language. A predator that
                  is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular),
                   the <span>Cats</span> is a solitary hunter but a social species.
                    It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency
                    
                    for human ears, such as those made by mice and other
                     small mammals.
            [7] It secretes and perceives pheromones.[8]</p>
